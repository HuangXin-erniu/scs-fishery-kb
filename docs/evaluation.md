- Status: protocol defined; the current question set was reviewed by the project owner in three batches (2026-11-04).
- Reviewed instrument (2026-11-04, 33 questions: 19 anchors, 8 abstention, 2 reference, 2 statistics, 2 deferred): hybrid **19/19** with MRR 0.68, abstention 7/8, one false refusal, answer rate 18/19, citation resolution 1.00, citation coverage 0.99, extractive faithfulness 1.00 and P95 20 ms; BM25 17/19 (MRR 0.64), BM25 plus lexicon 19/19 (0.69) and dense 15/19 (0.55). Reference 2/2, statistics 2/2, jurisdiction 3/3 and national 2/2. Q-E07 remains the one answered abstention test under the deterministic gate.
- LLM-assisted run (2026-11-04, `deepseek-v4.1-flash`, low reasoning effort, prompt `rag-v3`): hybrid **19/19** anchors, **8/8** abstention, **0 false refusals**, answer rate 19/19, citation resolution 1.00; model judge correctness **0.76**, completeness **0.66**, faithfulness **0.94**. Q-E07 now abstains because the evidence only lists other fishing grounds; Q-E12 answers from `POL-LAW-009` §第七十八条. These scores are model-assisted, not human review.
- Baseline (2026-11-03, adopted; 28 public documents, 785 chunks, index `20910f0964df`, dense `58ded7342e4c66fe`): BM25 8/11, BM25 plus lexicon 10/11, dense-only 8/11 and hybrid **11/11** with MRR 0.56, abstention 3/4, two false refusals and 100% citation resolution; hybrid P95 19 ms; reference 2/2, statistics 2/2, jurisdiction 3/3 and national 2/2. Cards and notes are not in this index: they live in a separate external store (259 documents, 315 chunks, index `0c6d3901106c`) and are consulted only after a non-abstained corpus answer.
- Claim-matrix experiment (2026-11-03, 287 documents with cards and notes, index `0137968fd40c`): chunks now carry source class, trust tier and review date, and hits are filtered by claim nature before answering (definition/rule/quantity/status/warning/identification/history). BM25 and lexicon abstention stayed at 3/4, but hybrid remained 9/11 with abstention 2/4; the filter cannot separate the out-of-scope question because the enlarged dense candidate pool already changes corpus ranking. Not adopted.
- Layered-gate experiment (2026-11-03, 287 documents with cards and notes, index `0137968fd40c`): a corpus-only gate was added (a chunk kind plus a corpus-evidence check, pass-through from `answer.require_corpus_evidence`) and measured. It restored BM25 abstention to 3/4 but hybrid still fell to 2/4 and recall to 9/11, so the flag did not make the enlarged index safe. The gate code stays (it is exercised by tests) but the enlarged index is not adopted; the corpus-only row below remains the baseline.
- Baseline (2026-11-03, corpus-only restored; 28 documents, 785 chunks, index `20910f0964df`, dense `58ded7342e4c66fe`): BM25 8/11, BM25 plus lexicon 10/11, dense 8/11, hybrid **11/11** with MRR 0.56, abstention 3/4, two false refusals and 100% citation resolution; reference 2/2, statistics 2/2, jurisdiction 3/3 and national 2/2. Two larger variants were measured and rejected: 287 documents with cards and notes (hybrid 9/11, abstention 2/4) and 147 documents with cards only (hybrid 11/11, abstention 2/4). Adding broad external evidence without an abstention-aware gate removed two correct refusals, so cards and notes remain unindexed in that experiment; the two-index architecture later moved them to a separate external store (see knowledge-policy.md §6).
- Baseline (2026-11-03, card era adopted; 36 indexed documents — 28 corpus documents plus 8 web cards — 849 chunks, index `5135e00cfa3d`, dense `56b9551d4b080bc3`): BM25 8/11, BM25 plus lexicon 10/11, dense 8/11, hybrid **11/11** with MRR 0.56, abstention 3/4, two false refusals and 100% citation resolution; reference 2/2, statistics 2/2, jurisdiction 3/3 and national 2/2. Two questions were fixed without touching their anchors: Q-E01 through one active synonym group (起止日期 → 休渔时间) and Q-M10 by asking the concrete permit-application question the row was testing; the old phrasing named no operation type and could not be answered. The eight cards add species taxonomy, gear classification, warning-signal definitions and ocean-colour product descriptions. Q-E08 and Q-M09 remain parked because the MUR/OLCI product pages are JavaScript applications; a later batch needs static official documents. This 36-document card-era index was superseded by the two-index architecture; the adopted corpus index is back to 28 documents.
- Baseline (2026-11-03, after removing the nine dead entries; 28 public sources, 785 chunks, index `20910f0964df`, dense `58ded7342e4c66fe`): BM25 7/11, BM25 plus lexicon 8/11, dense 7/11, hybrid 9/11 with MRR 0.42, abstention 3/4, three false refusals and 100% citation resolution. Hybrid loses one question (Q-M10, anchored on `POL-STD-010` article 28) after the smaller index changes the ranking; the deletion was ordered for scope reasons, so the regression is published rather than reverted, and a retrieval follow-up is recorded. Reference 4/4, statistics 2/2, jurisdiction 3/3 and national 2/2 are unchanged.
- Baseline (2026-11-02, after dropping the six fishery-economy bulletins; 31 public sources, 846 chunks, index `2ad41cc64de3`, dense `dd318a16c295a32f`): hybrid holds 10/11 with MRR 0.44, abstention 3/4, three false refusals and 100% citation resolution. The comparison arms move slightly with the smaller corpus: BM25 6/11, BM25 plus lexicon 7/11, dense 7/11. The capture series now comes from the nine fishery yearbooks plus the China Statistical Yearbook, and the statistics section stays at 2/2.
- Baseline (2026-11-02, after removing the two out-of-scope documents; 37 public sources, 894 chunks, index `a28bbbf43a22`, dense `273e42c147570649`): every arm is unchanged from the thirty-eight-document baseline — BM25 6/11, BM25 plus lexicon 7/11, dense 7/11, hybrid 10/11 with MRR 0.44, abstention 3/4, two false refusals and 100% citation resolution. Removing the ranch and breeding material cost two chunks and no metric.
- Baseline (2026-11-02, after admitting the five enforcement, catalogue and operations texts; 38 public sources, 896 chunks, index `499b420f49b0`, dense `af4b31ca3f941169`): hybrid holds at 10/11 with MRR 0.44, abstention 3/4, two false refusals and 100% citation resolution. The comparison arms move further under the larger corpus: BM25 6/11 (was 7/11), BM25 plus lexicon 7/11 (was 8/11), dense 7/11 with MRR 0.30 and three false refusals. The dilution from 102 new chunks is published as measured; the adopted arm keeps its recall and abstention, and its MRR moves by 0.01.
- Baseline (2026-11-02, after admitting the four national texts; 33 public sources, 794 chunks, index `cd97744aa292`, dense `f15c73a5996702f5`): hybrid holds at 10/11 with MRR 0.45, abstention 3/4, two false refusals and 100% citation resolution. The comparison arms move under the larger corpus: BM25 7/11 (was 8/11), BM25 plus lexicon 8/11 (was 9/11), dense 8/11 with MRR 0.32 (was 0.37) and three false refusals. The one-anchor drop in the BM25 arms is the expected dilution from 121 new chunks; the adopted arm is hybrid, so the batch is kept and the comparison numbers are published as they are rather than smoothed.

| Arm | Recall@5 | MRR | Abstention | False refusals | P95 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BM25 | 17/19 | 0.64 | 7/8 | 2 | — |
| BM25 + lexicon | 19/19 | 0.69 | 7/8 | 1 | — |
| Dense (bge-small-zh) | 15/19 | 0.55 | 7/8 | 2 | 20 ms |
| **Hybrid (adopted)** | **19/19** | **0.68** | **7/8** | **1** | **20 ms** |
| Hybrid + LLM (`--llm`) | 19/19 | 0.68 | **8/8** | **0** | 22 ms |

The LLM row also scores answer correctness 0.76, completeness 0.66 and faithfulness 0.94 with the model judge; these are model-assisted scores, not human review.

Adopted configuration (2026-11-04): the reviewed set has 33 questions — 19 anchors, 8 abstention tests, 2 CWP reference questions, 2 statistics questions and 2 deferred web questions. The corpus store decides answerability; the external store is a separate index and never participates in corpus abstention.

- Statistics channel (2026-11-01): the two statistical questions are scored separately. Q-E06 runs 南海区海洋捕捞产量历年趋势 and expects the sea-area production series; Q-M05 runs 2019年南海区拖网渔船数量 and expects vessel counts. Both return rows with edition and table citations (2/2). The channel also states the two gaps: production has no operation-type dimension and vessel counts have no sea-area dimension.
- Reference collections (2026-11-03): two questions are scored outside the main index. Q-E05 and Q-M04 use the CWP definition collection and both return the expected passage (2/2). Q-E08 and Q-M09 were answered by the product documents, which were removed on 2026-11-03; they are parked in the `web` queue and will be restored when the cached card layer lands. The interim reference rate is therefore 100% over two questions, not comparable with the earlier 4/4 over four.
- Policy collection (2026-11-02): the crew-management rule `POL-CREW-055` joined the policy collection and answers the minimum-manning question; the channel still requires one of its cues before it fires, so an unrelated question does not reach these documents.
- Abstention denominator: the reviewed set has eight out-of-scope tests (Q-E07, Q-E11, Q-M02, Q-M06, Q-M07, Q-M08, Q-M11, Q-M18); seven abstain and Q-E07 is still the known answered test.
- Answer assembly (2026-11-02): when a question asks for a period and not for an implementation date, the extractive answer searches every retrieved hit for a sentence carrying a date range and, if found, cites it first. Q-E01 now leads with the South China Sea clause from [POL-CLOS-015 §三、休渔时间] instead of the implementation date in §四; the retrieval, reference, statistics and abstention metrics are unchanged.
- National section (2026-11-02): two questions exercise the national-first ordering. J4 2026年海洋伏季休渔执法行动由哪些部门开展、重点任务是什么？ expects `POL-ENF-068` and J5 远洋渔船标准化船型参数系列表（2024年版）有哪些船型和参数？ expects `STD-YY-071`. The section reports 2/2 separately; like the jurisdiction questions it is same-set calibration, not a held-out split.
- Jurisdiction section (2026-11-02): three province questions are scored separately from the main arms: J1 海南省2026年伏季休渔的时间和海域是什么？ expecting `POL-HN-059`, J2 广西2026年海洋伏季休渔的时间与要求是什么？ expecting `POL-GX-060`, and J3 汕头市2026年海洋伏季休渔有哪些管理要求？ expecting `POL-GD-061`. The section exercises the province-first re-ranking and the answer lead, reports 3/3, and is same-set calibration rather than a held-out split.

## 1. Purpose

Evaluation answers three questions:

1. Does retrieval return the right evidence?
2. Do answers cite that evidence correctly and avoid fabrication?
3. Does the system abstain when the corpus cannot support an answer?

Human review is authoritative for answer correctness. Automated metrics are supporting evidence, not a substitute for expert review.

## 2. Question set

The reviewed set contains 33 questions: 15 for vessel operators and captains, 18 for fisheries administration. It contains 19 anchor questions, 8 abstention tests, 2 CWP reference questions, 2 statistics questions and 2 deferred web questions (Q-E08, Q-M09). Gold answer points are in `configs/eval.yaml`; the project owner approved the question decisions and gold points in three batches on 2026-11-04.

Before use:

- Domain experts review each question for realism and specificity.
- Unanswerable questions are kept as abstention tests, not deleted.
- Gold answers and evidence pages are added only when a reliable source exists.
- The set is expanded to 30–50 reviewed questions for the first baseline, with a target of 100+.
- Sensitive questions are excluded from the public repository; they remain in the local evaluation set.

The public draft is [questions.md](questions.md).

## 3. Metrics

### Retrieval

- Recall@k: whether the gold document/page appears in the top k results.
- MRR: mean reciprocal rank of the first relevant result.
- Hit@k: whether any relevant result appears in the top k.

### Citation

- Citation precision: the share of citations that resolve to a retrieved chunk.
- Citation coverage: the share of factual claims with at least one citation.
- Invalid-citation rate: citations that do not resolve or do not support the claim.

### Answer

- Correctness: agreement with the gold answer, judged by a human reviewer.
- Faithfulness: whether the answer is supported by the cited evidence.
- Completeness: whether the answer covers the required parts of the question.

### Abstention

- Out-of-scope refusal accuracy: the share of unanswerable questions that are refused.
- False-refusal rate: the share of answerable questions that are refused.

### Performance

- Retrieval latency, end-to-end latency, index build time and memory peak.

The instrument scores anchors, not answers: a question counts as retrieved when a top-5 chunk matches one of its gold anchors in `configs/eval.yaml` (document plus section prefix, or document plus page). Answer correctness, faithfulness and completeness still need reviewed gold answers and per-answer scoring; the deterministic run scores extractive faithfulness (answer sentences must come from cited chunks) and citation coverage, while the `--llm` run uses the model judge for correctness, completeness and faithfulness. Under the deterministic gate Q-E12 is refused although its anchor is retrieved, and Q-E07 is answered although no registered source covers historical fishing seasons; under `--llm` both are corrected (Q-E12 answers, Q-E07 abstains).

## 4. Protocol

1. **Split the set:** development, test and held-out subsets. The held-out subset is not used for tuning.
2. **Establish baselines:** BM25-only, dense-only and hybrid retrieval.
3. **Run the pipeline:** record the question, retrieved chunks, answer, citations, abstention and latency.
4. **Review:** a domain expert marks correctness and faithfulness; disagreements are recorded.
5. **Analyse errors:** classify retrieval misses, citation errors, answer errors and unnecessary refusals.
6. **Report:** publish aggregate metrics, per-type results and representative errors with evidence.

A question is scored only if its gold answer and evidence are reviewed. Unreviewed questions are reported separately and do not count toward acceptance.

## 5. Initial targets

These targets are provisional and will be calibrated after the first reviewed corpus.

| Dimension | Target |
|---|---|
| Recall@5 | ≥ 0.85 |
| MRR | ≥ 0.70 |
| Citation precision | ≥ 0.90 |
| Citation coverage | ≥ 0.90 |
| Answer correctness | ≥ 0.80 |
| Faithfulness | ≥ 0.85 |
| Out-of-scope refusal accuracy | ≥ 0.90 |
| Retrieval P95 latency | < 2 s |
| End-to-end P95 latency | < 5 s |

A missed target is investigated with error analysis; it is not hidden by changing the metric.

## 6. Reproducibility

Each run records:

- commit identifier and index version,
- embedding model and generation model identifiers,
- retrieval configuration (top-k, fusion, filters, reranking),
- commands and configuration files,
- evidence hashes for the retrieved chunks.

A report is reproducible when another maintainer can rerun the same commands against the same corpus and index version.

## 7. Data and ethics

- The evaluation set contains no restricted or personal data in the public repository.
- Public examples use synthetic or clearly public content.
- Restricted questions and answers stay local.
- Human reviewers do not copy restricted source text into public reports.
- Any data used in evaluation follows [data-policy.md](data-policy.md).

## 8. Reporting template

A run report should include:

1. Scope and corpus version.
2. Question-set version and split.
3. Configuration and model/index versions.
4. Aggregate metrics and per-type breakdown.
5. Representative successes and failures with citations.
6. Limitations and next actions.

## Retrieval tuning review (2026-11-03)

Q-M10 stayed the only hybrid miss after the corpus was pruned. The pipeline exposes four levers, and each was measured against the eleven anchored questions:

| Setting | Result |
|---|---|
| title_boost 0.0 / 0.5 / 1.0 / 2.0, BM25:dense 2:1, fusion_k 60 | 8 / 9 / 9 / 9 of 11 |
| BM25:dense 1:1, title_boost 1.0 | 9 of 11 |
| BM25:dense 1:2, title_boost 1.0 | 8 of 11 |
| lexicon additions 准入→申请/许可, 监管→监督检查, 作业规范→作业类型/作业方式 | 8 of 11 |

The gold articles (POL-STD-010 第二十八条 and POL-LAW-009 第三十五条) never entered the top five under any tested setting at the time of this review. Q-M10 was then a generic question ("某类作业规范的准入条件与监管要求") mapped to a specific application-materials article, so parameter tuning could not separate that article from the many documents that mention permits. This review is kept as history: the final fix was the Q-M10 rewrite, and the adopted baseline now retrieves 11/11. The parameters stay at title_boost 1.0 and BM25:dense 2:1, and the 28-document corpus index remains the adopted one; cards and notes live in the separate external store.
